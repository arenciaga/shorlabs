## Why deploying Python backends is still painful

You built something great with FastAPI. The API works locally, the routes are clean, and you're ready to share it with the world.

Then you Google "how to deploy FastAPI" and get hit with a wall of complexity:

- Write a Dockerfile
- Set up a reverse proxy with Nginx
- Provision an EC2 instance (or figure out ECS/Fargate)
- Configure security groups, IAM roles, and environment variables in the AWS console
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate future deployments

For a framework that takes 10 lines of code to write a working API, that's a lot of overhead just to put it on the internet.

There's a simpler way. You can deploy a FastAPI app straight from your GitHub repo, without touching Docker, without writing YAML, and without opening the AWS console. It takes about 5 minutes, and it's free.

## What you need

Two things:

1. **A GitHub repo** with a FastAPI app in it. Even a basic `main.py` with a single route works.
2. **A Shorlabs account.** It's free — no credit card required.

That's it. No Docker installed, no cloud accounts to configure, no CLI tools to learn.

Here's a minimal FastAPI app that works out of the box:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello from FastAPI!"}

@app.get("/health")
def health_check():
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

If your app looks something like this (or is way more complex — doesn't matter), you're good to go.

## Step 1: Connect your GitHub repo

Head to [shorlabs.com](https://shorlabs.com) and sign in with Google. You'll land on your projects dashboard.

Click **New Project**. Shorlabs will ask you to connect your GitHub account. Once connected, you'll see a list of your repositories. Pick the one with your FastAPI app.

That's the first step done. No SSH keys, no deploy tokens — just a standard GitHub OAuth connection.

## Step 2: Configure your project

After selecting your repo, you'll see a configuration screen. Here's what each option means:

**Project Name** — Give your project a name. This becomes part of your free subdomain (e.g., `my-api.shorlabs.com`).

**Root Directory** — If your FastAPI app is in the root of your repo, leave this as `./`. If it's nested in a subfolder like `backend/`, set it to `backend/`.

**Start Command** — Shorlabs auto-detects FastAPI and suggests the right command. For most apps, it will be:

```
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

If your app entry point is in a different file, just adjust the `main:app` part. For example, if your file is `server.py` and your FastAPI instance is called `application`, use `uvicorn server:application --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`.

**Memory** — Defaults to 1 GB. This is plenty for most FastAPI apps. You can bump it up later if you need to.

**Timeout** — How long each request can run before timing out. Default is 30 seconds. If you're doing heavy processing (ML inference, large file uploads), increase this.

**Ephemeral Storage** — Temporary disk space available during each request. Default is 1 GB. Most apps don't need to change this.

## Step 3: Deploy

Click **<u>Deploy</u>**. That's it.

Behind the scenes, Shorlabs clones your repo, installs your Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`, packages everything into a serverless function, and deploys it. You'll see real-time logs streaming as this happens.

The whole process usually takes 60 to 90 seconds. Once it's done, your project status changes to **LIVE**, and you get a URL like:

```
https://your-project.shorlabs.com
```

Hit that URL in your browser or with `curl`, and you'll see your FastAPI response.

```bash
curl https://your-project.shorlabs.com/
# {"message": "Hello from FastAPI!"}
```

Your FastAPI app is now live on the internet. No Docker. No YAML. No AWS console.

## Setting environment variables

Most real apps need environment variables — database URLs, API keys, secret tokens. You don't want these hardcoded in your repo.

In your project dashboard, go to the **Environment Variables** section. Add your variables as key-value pairs:

```
DATABASE_URL = postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db
SECRET_KEY = your-secret-key-here
OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-...
```

Click **Save Variables**. On your next deployment, these will be available to your app through `os.environ` — exactly how you'd use them locally.

```python
import os
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()
DATABASE_URL = os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL")
```

No `.env` files to manage on a server. No secrets stored in your repo.

## Connecting a custom domain

Your app gets a free `*.shorlabs.com` subdomain automatically. But if you want to use your own domain (like `api.yourcompany.com`), you can set that up too.

In your project settings, go to the **Domains** section and enter your domain. Shorlabs will give you a CNAME record to add in your DNS provider (Cloudflare, Namecheap, Route 53 — wherever you manage your domain).

Add the CNAME record, wait a few minutes for DNS to propagate, and your custom domain is live with automatic SSL.

## Viewing real-time logs

One thing that makes debugging deployed apps painful is not being able to see what's happening. On traditional setups, you need to SSH into a server, or dig through CloudWatch, or set up a logging pipeline.

On Shorlabs, go to your project dashboard and click **Logs**. You'll see a live stream of your function's output — every `print()` statement, every request, every error traceback.

If something's wrong, you'll see it here in real time. No extra setup.

## What about costs?

Shorlabs uses a **pay-per-request** model. Your app runs on serverless infrastructure, which means:

- **No idle costs.** If nobody is hitting your API, you're not paying anything.
- **Free tier included.** The Hobby plan gives you 3,000 requests/month and 1,200 GB-seconds of compute — free, forever, no credit card required.
- **Scale when you need to.** If your app takes off, you only pay for what you use ($0.60 per million requests).

Compare that to a $7/month server that sits idle 95% of the time.

## Redeploying

Made changes to your code? Push to GitHub, then click **Redeploy** in your project dashboard. Shorlabs pulls the latest code, rebuilds, and swaps in the new version. Zero downtime.

You can also set up **auto-deploy** so that every push to your main branch triggers a new deployment automatically — no manual clicks needed.

## Wrapping up

Here's what just happened:

1. You connected a GitHub repo.
2. You configured a project name, start command, and memory.
3. You clicked **<u>Deploy</u>**.

Your FastAPI app is now live on a production URL, with environment variables, custom domain support, real-time logs, and pay-per-request pricing. The whole thing took under 5 minutes.

No Docker. No YAML. No DevOps.
